#Â Deployment data

NHS Digital has invested in some automated deployment tooling which has recorded its deployment history.

The data is made up of a number of projects, a more detailed description is shown below.

```
Each project has a:

  project_id: A unique GUID

  project_group: A parent project group name of which the project is a member

  environments: A list of deployment environments that the project is deployed to, for example:
		    Integration
		    Regression
		    QA
		    UAT
		    Live

  releases: one or more release. Each release details:

    version: a unique version identifier

    deployments: one or more deployments associated with a particular release.  Each deployment details:

      environment: the environment the release was deployed to

      created: a timestamp when the deployment took place

      state: whether the deployment was successful

      name: the name of the deployment
```

Please note:

- Versions are ordered from earliest to latest
- Deployments are ordered from earliest to latest
